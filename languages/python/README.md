# Python Implementation (Planned)

## Status: ðŸ”„ Research Pending

Python is our next target for applying Rust patterns. Based on Python's characteristics, we expect:

## Hypotheses

### Likely Effective Patterns

1. **Buffer Reuse**
   - NumPy arrays for in-place operations
   - `bytearray` for mutable buffers
   - Memory views with `memoryview()`

2. **Zero-Copy Operations**
   - NumPy views and slicing
   - `struct` module for type punning
   - Buffer protocol for zero-copy

3. **Async Optimizations**
   - `asyncio` task batching
   - Stream buffering with `async for`
   - Proper event loop usage

### Likely Ineffective Patterns

1. **Multiprocessing**
   - GIL limits thread parallelism
   - Process overhead similar to Dart isolates
   - Only beneficial for CPU-bound tasks >10MB

2. **Ownership Semantics**
   - Reference counting already handles memory
   - Would add overhead without benefits

## Planned Benchmarks

```python
# 1. Allocation patterns
- List comprehension vs preallocation
- NumPy arrays vs Python lists
- Object pooling with __slots__

# 2. Zero-copy patterns
- memoryview vs slicing
- NumPy views vs copies
- struct unpacking vs manual conversion

# 3. Async patterns
- asyncio.create_task vs gather
- Async generators vs lists
- Event loop scheduling strategies

# 4. Concurrency patterns
- threading vs multiprocessing
- concurrent.futures performance
- Shared memory approaches
```

## Expected Challenges

1. **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**
   - Prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks
   - May need to explore `multiprocessing` or `nogil` builds

2. **Dynamic Typing**
   - Type checking overhead
   - May benefit from type hints + mypy/mypyc

3. **Interpreter Overhead**
   - CPython vs PyPy vs Cython considerations
   - JIT compilation effects

## Integration Opportunities

- **NumPy/Pandas**: Already use many Rust-like patterns
- **Cython**: Compile hot paths to C
- **PyO3**: Direct Rust integration
- **Numba**: JIT compilation for numerical code

## Research Questions

1. How much do NumPy views improve over copies?
2. Can asyncio match Rust's async performance?
3. When does multiprocessing overcome its overhead?
4. How effective is object pooling in Python?
5. Can memoryview provide Rust-like zero-copy?

## How to Contribute

1. Port the Dart benchmarks to Python
2. Use `timeit` and `memory_profiler` for measurements
3. Test on CPython 3.11+ (with performance improvements)
4. Document findings in this README
5. Update the pattern applicability matrix
